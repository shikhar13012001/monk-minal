## Issues and PRs

If you have suggestions for how this project could be improved, or want to report a bug, open an issue! We'd love all and any contributions. If you have questions, too, we'd love to hear them.

We'd also love PRs. If you're thinking of a large PR, we advise opening up an issue first to talk about it, though! Look at the links below if you're not sure how to open a PR.

1. [Fork][fork] and clone the repository.
2. Configure and install the dependencies: `npm install`.
3. Create a new branch: `git checkout -b my-branch-name`.
4. Work on your issue/feature
5. Before committing the changes run tests using `npm link` and test the cli using `mnm` command.
6. Follow [Conventional Commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/) for writing commit messages
7. Push to your fork and [submit a pull request][pr] in `main` branch
8. Pat your self on the back and wait for your pull request to be approved and merged.

Here are a few things you can do that will increase the likelihood of your pull request being accepted:

- Keep your changes as focused as possible. If there are multiple changes you would like to make that are not dependent upon each other, consider submitting them as separate pull requests.
- Follow [Conventional commits](https://www.conventionalcommits.org/en/v1.0.0/).

Work in Progress pull requests are also welcome to get feedback early on, or if there is something blocked you. (just mark them as draft)
